# DjangoReactFramework

This project is a Django, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, and Docker framework.

Instead of integrating all of the above for each project I thought to just save the framework.  The web development framework is all ready to go with some example programming, such as a navbar and hello world title.  If someone out there does use this, remember to change the SECRET_KEY in the settings.py file.
